🛠️ Multi-Purpose Unit Converter & Logic Tools
A clean, responsive web application featuring a suite of practical tools ranging from health calculators (BMI) to real-time math logic and string manipulation.

🚀 Features
This project includes 8 functional tools built into a single, cohesive interface:

Age to Days Converter: Uses a calendar input to calculate exactly how many days you've been alive, accounting for leap years.

Hours to Seconds: A quick conversion tool for time units.

Find Next in Array: Demonstrates array indexing by finding the successor of a number within a predefined list.

Next Number Logic: Intelligent logic that detects if an input is an Integer (adds 1) or a Float (adds 0.1).

First Letter Capitalizer: Automatically formats names by capitalizing the first letter and lowering the rest.

BMI Calculator: Calculates Body Mass Index and provides an instant health category status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).

Random Array Picker: Generates a random array and extracts the first and last elements using JavaScript.

Live Addition (NaN Handling): Real-time math using event listeners. Displays NaN until both inputs are valid, demonstrating JavaScript's type-handling.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Semantic structure for the web forms and containers.

CSS3: Custom styling with CSS Variables, Flexbox layouts, and glassmorphism-inspired UI.

JavaScript (ES6+):

DOM Manipulation

Event Listeners (input events)

Date Objects & Math functions

Array methods and String manipulation
